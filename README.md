Networking init CMS sandbox based on the networking init CMS and the Symfony Standard Edition
=============================================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/networking/init-cms-sandbox.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/networking/init-cms-sandbox)


Welcome to the init CMS Sandbox. This will get you started with a working CMS based
on the [InitCmsBundle](https://github.com/networking/init-cms-bundle) and Symfony 2.

The InitCmsBundle is a small flexible cms core based on symfony 2 which can be used as a standalone CMS or integrated into
any existing symfony 2 project.

The main features are:
- Page manager with draft and published states, as well as public or protected (login only) pages, and customised URLs
- Menu manager to organise multiple menu bars
- Media manager and gallery manager
- User manager with ACL access control
- Help page manager

Other Features:
- Integrate your own twig templates
- Create your own content types
- Based on the SonataAdminBundle so you can easily create your own admin modules



The project is being developed by the
small hard working team at [net working AG][1] in ZÃ¼rich.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE** This project is very much in an Alpha stage.
It is not advisable to use this for a production web site.

The installation of the sandbox is pretty much the same as a normal installation of Symfony project.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using the networking init CMS sandbox. For a more detailed explanation on install Symfony, see the [Installation][17]
chapter of the Symfony Documentation.

1) Installing the networking init CMS sandbox
---------------------------------------------

For the moment you will need to download an archive, then run composer to install the
dependencies. We will soon have the project on packagist, after that you will be able to use
the create-project command.

### Download an Archive File

First [download][2] and unpack the archive of the sandbox in your preferred location

	https://github.com/networking/init-cms-sandbox/archive/master.zip

Then change into the project directory

	cd path/to/install

Create a parameters.yml file:

	cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][3] to manage its dependencies, which is why we also use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Composer will install the networking init CMS and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

Now you will need to install the dependencies, the following command will fill the vendors
folder with all the working guts in accordance with the versions defined in the composer.lock
file:

    php composer.phar install


Now we just need to create some folders for our media in the web root directory and make it RW+

	mkdir web/uploads web/uploads/media
	chmod -R 777 web/uploads


2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

Access the `config.php` script from a browser:

    http://localhost/config.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

If all is good, you can move on to configuring the DB set up by clicking the
"Configure your Symfony Application online" link, or by editing the paramters.yml
file directly


3) Run the networking init CMS installation
-------------------------------------------

Now that the symfony application is more or less setup, it is time to load the CMS DBs and
fixtures, as well as create an admin user. The following command will do that for you. You will
be prompted to enter a username, email address and password, these will get you into the backend.


	php app/console networking:initcms:install

Now you should be up and running.

4) Login to the admin area
--------------------------

It should now be possible to login to the backend admin interface of the project. Just
navigate to:

	http://localhost/app_dev.php/admin

Enter your username and password as entered in step 3 and you should be directed to the
admin dashboard.
